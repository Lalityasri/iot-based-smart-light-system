# iot-based-smart-light-system

## Project Overview
This project presents an IoT-based Smart Light System designed to automate and remotely control lighting using internet-enabled devices. The system uses a microcontroller (NodeMCU ESP8266), sensors (like LDR and motion sensors), and cloud-based platforms to enable energy-efficient, user-friendly lighting control.

The core objective is to reduce energy consumption and increase user convenience by automatically switching lights based on environmental conditions and user presence. This project also enables real-time remote control and monitoring via a mobile app or web interface.
